## Professionally

I'm a Solutions Architect at a Cloud Computing company--I love to help people solve their problems in efficient ways. Empathy is a strength and a weakness as I have a passion for helping solve the problems I myself have encountered.

In my career I've worn many hats:
  -  A production support specialist for TIBCO systems (ugh)
  -  A Java Developer building Java Spring Web Backends for mobile apps
  -  A Data Analytics Engineer writing Spark jobs and working with Data Scientists to develop scalable Machine Learning Algorithms
  -  A Data Engineer developing streaming pipelines for data science algorithms using Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.
  -  And now, a Solutions Architect, helping businesses across the world build their systems better.

That being said, I love my job when I'm working, and never want to think about it when I'm off the clock.

## Personally
I love all things creative--music, movies, art, science, and especially comedy.
- I love going to concerts and music festivals.
- I love watching movies and diving deep into the meaning behind them.
- I love laughing and making my friends laugh.
- I love going to a steakhouse and ordering a burger. (Pro Tip: They make the best burgers).
- I like traveling, but want to do more of it.
- I love going to Las Vegas and playing Blackjack all night.
- I love to read and I love scary stories.
- I love debating about absolutely anything with my friends. A spirited debate!


## My goals
- One day I want to curate a music festival.
- One day I want to be known as a great host.
- One day I'd like to own a house.
- One day I'd like to be able to do a full downward dog.
- One day I'd like to write something so funny it makes someone laugh.
