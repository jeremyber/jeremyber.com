[[deployment.targets]]
# An arbitrary name for this target.
name = "my-site"
# The Go Cloud Development Kit URL to deploy to. Examples:
# GCS; see https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/#gcs
# URL = "gs://<Bucket Name>"

# S3; see https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/#s3
# For S3-compatible endpoints, see https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/#s3-compatible
URL = "s3://jeremyber.com?region=us-east-2"

# Azure Blob Storage; see https://gocloud.dev/howto/blob/#azure
# URL = "azblob://$web"

# You can use a "prefix=" query parameter to target a subfolder of the bucket:
# URL = "gs://<Bucket Name>?prefix=a/subfolder/"

# If you are using a CloudFront CDN, deploy will invalidate the cache as needed.
# cloudFrontDistributionID = <ID>

# Optionally, you can include or exclude specific files.
# See https://godoc.org/github.com/gobwas/glob#Glob for the glob pattern syntax.
# If non-empty, the pattern is matched against the local path.
# All paths are matched against in their filepath.ToSlash form.
# If exclude is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path matches it, that file is not synced.
# If include is non-empty, and a local or remote file's path does not match it, that file is not synced.
# As a result, local files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not uploaded to remote,
# and remote files that don't pass the include/exclude filters are not deleted.
# include = "**.html" # would only include files with ".html" suffix
# exclude = "**.{jpg, png}" # would exclude files with ".jpg" or ".png" suffix


# [[deployment.matchers]] configure behavior for files that match the Pattern.
# Samples:

# [[deployment.matchers]]
#  Cache static assets for 1 year.
# pattern = "^.+\\.(js|css|svg|ttf)$"
# cacheControl = "max-age=31536000, no-transform, public"
# gzip = true

# [[deployment.matchers]]
# pattern = "^.+\\.(png|jpg)$"
# cacheControl = "max-age=31536000, no-transform, public"
# gzip = false

# [[deployment.matchers]]
# pattern = "^.+\\.(html|xml|json)$"
# gzip = true
